                    <h5>Data Warehouse is a search engine and resource guide for SQL developers and business analysts 
                        using the SQL databases to build queries and tableau reports. The stakeholders were looking for a 
                        new site that was faster and visually more modern.

                    </div>
                    <h5>UX Challenges</h5>
                    <p>The main UX challenges facing the existing Data Warehouse site were the a clear user path and the data table that returned the search results. The user 
                        path starts at the landing page. The user's desired end goal is the search form, but the landing page does not present a clear way to get to the search form. 
                        There are multiple quick links and links disguised as section titles, both of which are confusing to the user. Once the user does navigate to the form, fills out the 
                        form and submits the form, a data table is returned with all of the results. The first issue with the data table was that there was no feedback to the user that 
                        the table was loading except for the browser tab loading symbol and the fact that the table kept growing. The second issue was that the headers were not 
                        fixed meaning when the user scrolled down the page, they lost site of what each column meant, ultimately becoming lost in a sea of table cells. Finally, the 
                        table cells were not responsive. They were all fixed to the same width whether they consisted of 12 characters or 120 characters. This resulted in a lot of wasted 
                        space and wrapping of text creating different heights of rows.

                    <h5>UX Solutions</h5>
                    <p>The landing page was scrapped entirely. Since the main goal of the site was to get to the search form, we had the user arrive at the search form 
                        immediately when they arrived at the site. All of the reference information and quick links were then place in a mega menu that was now accessible from any 
                        page. Once the user submitted the form, they would be presented with a spinning circle until the table was fully loaded. This informs the user that there form 
                        has been submitted and their table is loading. The table itself has fixed headers, with only the data cells scrolling. The columns were made responsive and also 
                        given a max-width. When a data cell's contents exceeds the max-width, the data is cut-off and an ellipsis button is inserted into the cell. When the user clicks 
                        the ellipsis, a tooltip pops up showing the user the full cell information. On export of the table to an Excel spreadsheet, all information would be displayed in the 
                        cells.

                    <h5>Design Challenges</h5>
                    <p>The existing site was quite dated and needed to be updated to more modern look. Any colors used needed to easy to read within a data table, or not take 
                        away from the main aspects of the site. The site also needed it's own identity outside of the parent corporation. It would need it's own logo and branding. It is 
                        also always important to bear in mind that this site, while not displaying any private medical information, is still being used to do exactly that and should adhere 
                        to HIPAA standards when possible.
                    </p>

                    <img class="ux-img" src="img/datawarehousebranding.png">
                    <h5>Design Solutions</h5>
                    <p>To update the site to a more modern look, I decided to use whitespace as a key element. The whitespace would create a cleaner look overall and keep 
                        user's gaze on the important areas. With color, I stuck with dark grey and dark navy blue as the base colors. These would be easy to read as a data table, but 
                        combined with the white, would read professional and modern. For the accent colors, I wanted to use tonal blues to create subtle changes for all of the links on 
                        the site and then a bright, bold orange that would tie in with the navy and grey, but give the call-to-action buttons a clear role. The branding was kept to a 
                        minimum and in the end, only one logo would be required. The logo would sit at the top navigation bar. For the logo, I wanted to convey the deep and complex 
                        nature of the site but keep it simple. I made the name of the site with tonal blue lines and dots that feels modern, technical, and clean.
